Nims: My Nim Experiments
===

A place for programs in Nim I write for exercising. So far you can find the following programs here:

* **bibliotekar.nim** - a GUI-less program to catalog files
* **palitra.nim** - a desktop app to input different Latin symbols

Just type `nim c -r PROGRAM_NAME.nim` in your terminal to compile and run the program you want to use.

In case something is "unnimic" in my code, remember I came from Python.
